# Windows10BloatAndTelemetryDisabler
C# console application that can disable bloat and telemetry in W10.  Based on a bash script written by Martin at HWINFO forum: https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/Thread-Remove-Windows-10-Bloat.

The application also includes option to reverse the disabler process but isn't entirely complete at the moment.

ToDo:
- Adjust reversal methods to completely reverse the removal process.
- Project cleanup (VS Solution is misnamed)
- Add GUI
- Change namespace
